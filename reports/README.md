# Project Milestone Report

## Using the ICML Template

This draft uses a minimal article setup. For submission, replace with the official **ICML 2024 template**:

1. Download from: https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2024/Styles/
2. Use `icml2024.sty` and the provided `icml2024.tex` structure
3. Copy the content from `milestone_draft.tex` into the template

## Compiling

```bash
pdflatex milestone_draft
pdflatex milestone_draft  # run twice for references
```

## Placeholder

The learning curve figure is a placeholder. Replace with actual plots from training (e.g., from wandb or matplotlib).
